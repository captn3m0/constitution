NOTES 

Policy underlying the Article : This Article based on 8. 299 of the 
Government of India Act, 1935, was the result of considerable negotiation 
and incorporates what was popularly known as the Munshi-Iyengar formula 
which was agreed to as a compromise between two sets of views. This 
Article evoked keen controversy in the Constituent Assembly and outside. 

This Article limits the rights of eminent domain. In general, the 
right of a nation or State to take private property for public use is eminent 
or paramount. It is a right that transcends private ownership. It is 
inherent in the nature of sovereignty 'that a government shall have the 
right 1 to acquire private property for an essential public use even when 
the owner of the property objects to giving it up. Otherwise, a Govern- 
ment could not perform its functions, because private property is needed 
from time to time for fortifications, navy-yards, post-offices, customs 
houses, school houses, parks, highways, and so on. ' 
“Property”—meaning of: At the common law 'property’ signified 
ownership, which was exercised in its primary and fullest sense over 
physical objects only, and more especially over land. 1 To-day in Consti- 
tution Law it covers each and all of the valuable elements of ownership, 
and moreover baa tended at times to merge with the more indefinite rights 
of 'liberty;' as defined above.
1.In Early England, it was the custom for the Crown to take private 
property for its use without giving the owner any compensation at all. The King 
was supposed to have what was called the right of "purveyance” and this right 
of the King extended to the taking of land, buildings, cattle, grain and in fact
 any- 
thing the King wanted.
Subtl (2) : "Public Purposes" : When the legislature enacts 
certain purposes as public or clothes the Executive with authority so to 
notify, the courts cannot question the enactment. Cf. Wijiasekara v. 
Vesting, (1919) A. C. 646. 

"Compensation" : It is clear on the language of this Article 
that a legislation cannot be impugned as not providing a just compen- 
sation. The question what is a just compensation is a matter for the 
legislature and so long as some compensation is provided for, the 
legislation cannot be attacked as invalid. 


32. Remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part.—(1)
The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the
enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed.
(2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or
writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition,
quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the
enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part.
(3) Without prejudice to the powers conferred on the Supreme Court by
clauses (1) and (2), Parliament may by law empower any other court to exercise
within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable
 by
the Supreme Court under clause (2).
(4) The right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as
otherwise provided for by this Constitution.
