NOTES 

Policy underlying the Article : This Article based on 8. 299 of the 
Government of India Act, 1935, was the result of considerable negotiation 
and incorporates what was popularly known as the Munshi-Iyengar formula 
which was agreed to as a compromise between two sets of views. This 
Article evoked keen controversy in the Constituent Assembly and outside. 

This Article limits the rights of eminent domain. In general, the 
right of a nation or State to take private property for public use is eminent 
or paramount. It is a right that transcends private ownership. It is 
inherent in the nature of sovereignty 'that a government shall have the 
right 1 to acquire private property for an essential public use even when 
the owner of the property objects to giving it up. Otherwise, a Govern- 
ment could not perform its functions, because private property is needed 
from time to time for fortifications, navy-yards, post-offices, customs 
houses, school houses, parks, highways, and so on. ' 
‚ÄúProperty‚Äù‚Äîmeaning of: At the common law 'property‚Äô signified 
ownership, which was exercised in its primary and fullest sense over 
physical objects only, and more especially over land. 1 To-day in Consti- 
tution Law it covers each and all of the valuable elements of ownership, 
and moreover baa tended at times to merge with the more indefinite rights 
of 'liberty;' as defined above.
1.In Early England, it was the custom for the Crown to take private 
property for its use without giving the owner any compensation at all. The King 
was supposed to have what was called the right of "purveyance‚Äù and this right 
of the King extended to the taking of land, buildings, cattle, grain and in fact
 any- 
thing the King wanted.
Subtl (2) : "Public Purposes" : When the legislature enacts 
certain purposes as public or clothes the Executive with authority so to 
notify, the courts cannot question the enactment. Cf. Wijiasekara v. 
Vesting, (1919) A. C. 646. 

"Compensation" : It is clear on the language of this Article 
that a legislation cannot be impugned as not providing a just compen- 
sation. The question what is a just compensation is a matter for the 
legislature and so long as some compensation is provided for, the 
legislation cannot be attacked as invalid. 


31A. Saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates, etc.‚Äî
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law providing for‚Äî
(a) the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein
or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights, or
(b) the taking over of the management of any property by the State
for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the
proper management of the property, or
(c) the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public
interest or in order to secure the proper management of any of the
corporations, or
(d) the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing
agents, secretaries and treasurers, managing directors, directors or
managers of corporations, or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof,
or
(e) the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by
virtue of any agreement, lease or licence for the purpose of searching for,
or winning, any mineral or mineral oil, or the premature termination or
cancellation of any such agreement, lease or licence,
shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes
away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, article 19 or articl
e 31:
Provided that where such law is a law made by the Legislature of a State,
the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having
been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent:

15

THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA

Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the
acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is
held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the
State to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applica
ble
to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure
standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the
acquisition of such land, building or structure, provides for payment of
compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof.
(2) In this article,‚Äî
(a) the expression ‚Äúestate‚Äù shall, in relation to any local area, have the

include‚Äî

31B. Validation of certain Acts and Regulations.‚ÄîWithout prejudice
to the generality of the provisions contained in article 31A, none of the Acts
and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions
thereof shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground
that such Act, Regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or
abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provisions of this Part, and
notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or Tribunal to the
contrary, each of the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of
any competent Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force.

31C. Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles.‚Äî
Notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law giving effect to the
policy of the State towards securing 1 [all or any of the principles laid down i
n
Part IV] shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, 
or
takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, article 19 or 
article 31;
2
and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy
shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give eff
ect
to such policy:
Provided that where such law is made by the Legislature of a State, the
provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been
reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent.
